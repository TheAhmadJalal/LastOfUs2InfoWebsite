        Dina's flashback

            At some point prior to 2033, Dina moved to Jackson under the leadership of Tommy and Maria. During their
            trip to Seattle, Dina told Ellie her first kill was when she was ten, stabbing a man who tried to attack her
            mother. She also became acquainted with Jesse, another survivor who lived within the settlement.[2]
            <br><br><br><br>

            After Ellie and Joel found safety within Jackson, Dina became friends with the former. She also dated Jesse,
            though they eventually broke up.A few days after the end of Dina and Jesse's relationship, there is a
            celebration in a church within the settlement. Dina dances with a man from the group, much to the jealousy
            of her ex-boyfriend. She invites Ellie, who is drinking at the bar, to dance with her. While dancing, Dina
            kisses Ellie, remarking that the other boys in the village should be "terrified" because Ellie has more of a
            chance with Dina than they do.
            <br><br><br><br>
            The day after, Dina and Ellie are assigned to patrol the creek trails, the route which Dina had previously
            covered with the late Eugene Linden. While on patrol, they talk about their respective previous
            relationships with Cat and Jesse, cheesy action films Joel enjoys, and dreams of traveling to different
            places.After dealing with numerous Infected along their route, a strong blizzard develops and they take
            shelter in a library. Here, they discover that Eugene had been growing marijuana. While sharing an old
            joint, Dina confronts Ellie about their kiss the previous night, leading to another passionate kiss and the
            pair consummating their relationship.
            <br><br><br><br>
            The character has been well-received by critics, with Ellie's relationship with Joel most frequently the
            subject of praise. The strength and complexity of her character, and its subversion of the damsel in
            distress stereotype, have also been commended. A scene in which Ellie and Riley kiss in Left Behind drew
            social commentary and was commended as a leap for LGBT representation in video games. Johnson's performance
            in Part II was praised for her depiction of vulnerability and suffering. Both the character and performance
            received numerous awards and nominations, and have regularly placed favorably in polls and lists.
