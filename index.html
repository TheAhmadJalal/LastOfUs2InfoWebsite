            <p class="section-subtag Text-small">The Last of Us Part II, a 2020 action-adventure game developed by
                Naughty Dog and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment, focuses on two lead characters: Ellie, who
                sets out for revenge after suffering a great tragedy, and Abby Anderson, a soldier who becomes involved
                in a conflict between her militia and a cult. The switch between the playable characters was a major
                point of the game's development, based on a similar switch in the original game, 2013's The Last of Us.

            <p class="section-subtag Text-small"> Part of the game deals with Ellie's relationship with Joel, the first
                game's protagonist, who lied to her. Ellie is joined by several companions in the game, including her
                girlfriend Dina, friend Jesse, and Joel's brother Tommy. Abby is a member of the Washington Liberation
                Front, which also includes her ex-boyfriend Owen and her friend Manny, and is led by Isaac. Throughout
                her journey, Abby meets and protects Yara and Lev, siblings from the opposing cult known as the
                Seraphites.

            <p class="section-subtag Text-small"> Creative director Neil Druckmann co-wrote the story and developed the
                characters of Part II with Halley Gross. The performances were recorded using performance capture, which
                records motion and voice simultaneously. Actors were given considerable license to improvise or suggest
                ideas while performing. One of the writers' goals was to create multifaceted characters, especially in
                Ellie, and they wanted to explore the vulnerabilities of Abby to ensure that the player could empathize
                with her. The characters received a generally positive reception, with acclaim for the performances.
                For The Last of Us Part II, the actors' performances were recorded at a studio in Playa Vista, Los
                Angeles using performance capture, recording motion and voice simultaneously.[1] The actors wore motion
                capture suits and head-mounted cameras that track facial muscles and eye movements.[2] Recording ran
                from 2017 to April 2019.[3][1] The actors were allowed to improvise or suggest ideas while performing;
                he said that he would do "20 or 30 takes if need be".[4] Co-writer Halley Gross noted that a goal of the
                writers was to "create the most multifaceted characters you've seen in games".[5] She particularly
                wanted to explore the multifaceted behavior of Ellie, showing her power as well as her insecurities.[6]
                She wanted the story to show that "there are no heroes or villains".[7] Writer and director Neil
                Druckmann found that all three playable characters—Joel in the first game, and Ellie and Abby in Part
                II—mirror each other as they are all suffering with overcoming trauma and "quietening their demons".[8]

                The change of player character from Ellie to Abby was inspired by the change from Joel to Ellie in the
                first game, though emphasized in Part II due to its focus on empathy.[9] Druckmann found that players
                acted differently when forced to play as Ellie in the first game, and wanted to replicate a similar
                change with Abby in Part II.[10] Druckmann was also inspired by the character switch of Metal Gear Solid
                2: Sons of Liberty (2001), which had been suppressed in that game's marketing.[11] The writers
                experimented with interspersing Ellie and Abby's gameplay sections, but ultimately settled on longer
                segments.[12] Druckmann found that Ellie's attempt for revenge was mirrored by Abby, who had already
                achieved it by avenging her father. Early playtests of the final fight led to confusion regarding
                Ellie's decision to spare Abby; the editorial team suggested adding a flash of Joel playing guitar,
                which Druckmann felt was an effective balance between explicit and implicit motivation. For more than
                half of production, Ellie killed Abby in the game's conclusion,[9] and would return to the farm and be
                tortured but spared by a relative of somebody Ellie killed. Druckmann felt that this was thematically
                relevant, but realized that it focused too heavily on the themes rather than characters;[13] after
                conversations about Yara and Lev, they found that it felt dishonest and that Ellie still had some
                goodness.[9] Druckmann wanted players to support both characters in the final fight, and realize how
                futile it is.[14]
