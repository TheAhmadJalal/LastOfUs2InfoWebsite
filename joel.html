            Joel Miller (Troy Baker) is the protagonist of The Last of Us. Originally from Texas, Joel was a single
            father in his late 20s when the initial Cordyceps outbreak occurred. Fleeing with his brother Tommy and his
            twelve-year-old daughter Sarah, they got involved in a firefight with a soldier, and Sarah was mortally
            wounded and died in his arms, leaving him traumatized. In the 20 years that follow, Joel did whatever he had
            to do to survive.
            <br><br><br><br>
            Twenty years after Sarah's death, Joel works as a smuggler in the Boston quarantine zone with his friend and
            partner Tess. While out searching for a former accomplice who stole some of their merchandise, Joel and Tess
            are tasked by Marlene, an acquaintance and leader of a rebel militia called the Fireflies, to smuggle Ellie
            to a rendezvous point. Joel discovers that Ellie is immune to the infection. Upon their arrival, Tess
            reveals that she has sustained a bite on the journey, and insists Joel finds Tommy, a former Firefly, in
            order to continue the mission. Joel is initially surly and short towards Ellie, though he begins to warm up
            to her as their journey continues. This is compounded when Joel, having initially asked Tommy to carry on in
            his place after meeting up with him, changes his mind and carries on as planned. Their bond deepens when
            Ellie nearly loses Joel to a severe injury, and when he comes to her aid after she is nearly killed by a
            band of cannibals. Ultimately, Joel shows his devotion to Ellie when he chooses to rescue her from the
            doctors who plan to remove and examine her brain, as opposed to allowing her to die. To ensure they are not
            pursued, Joel kills Marlene. Driving away, Ellie wakes up, after which Joel tells her the doctors gave up on
            discovering a cure. Ellie later confronts him about the events, and Joel swears to her that he was telling
            the truth.

            When designing Joel's physical appearance, the team tried to make him look "flexible enough" to allow for
            him to appear as both a "ruthless operator in the underground of a quarantined city" as well as a "caring
            father figure to Ellie".[12] When writing the character of Joel, Druckmann initially took inspiration from
            Josh Brolin's portrayal of Llewelyn Moss in No Country for Old Men (2007), which he saw as "very quiet, very
            cool under pressure". However, Baker's interpretation of Joel as a more emotional person evolved the
            character in a different way.[13] Druckmann felt that players, specifically parents, would be able to relate
            to Joel's character and his bonding with Ellie.[14] Druckmann became intrigued by players who discussed
            Joel's morality, distinguishing him as a hero or villain; Druckmann felt that Joel was only "a complex
            person who's made good and bad decisions", but allowed it to be open to interpretation.[15] When auditioning
            for the role, Baker read a phrase on the character sheet that stated Joel had "few moral lines left to
            cross", which became the "anchor point" to the character for him.

            Baker returned to portray Joel in The Last of Us Part II (2020).[16] Pedro Pascal will play the role in the
            upcoming HBO television adaptation of the game.
