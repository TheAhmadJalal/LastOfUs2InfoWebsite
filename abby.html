            Abigail "Abby" Anderson is a fictional character in the video game The Last of Us Part II (2020) by Naughty
            Dog. She is portrayed by Laura Bailey through performance capture. A soldier of the Washington Liberation
            Front, Abby seeks to avenge her father's death by killing Joel Miller, and her alliances later become
            unsettled when she befriends ex-members of the Seraphites, a religious cult with which her militia is locked
            in a war. Abby is one of two main playable characters in the game, alongside Ellie.
            <br><br><br><br>
            Abby was created by Neil Druckmann and Halley Gross, the writers of The Last of Us Part II. The original
            switch to playing as Abby was done to demonstrate her personality; Druckmann wanted players to hate Abby
            early in the game, but later empathize with her through her flaws and redemptive actions. He wanted to avoid
            casting Bailey due to her proliferation of roles, but was impressed with her audition tape in how she had
            played into Abby's vulnerability. Bailey worked out in preparation for the role, and gave birth to her first
            son during production. She also prepared by researching people involved in wars and their coping mechanisms.
            Abby's face was modelled on Jocelyn Mettler, while her body was based on Colleen Fotsch.

            The character of Abby was well-received by critics, with many noting that her redemption arc was believable
            and made the character likeable by the game's end. Her playable chapters were controversial among players,
            and Bailey became the target of online death threats; some critics felt that the character had been unfairly
            maligned, and that criticisms of her muscular physique was a result of the lack of body diversity in video
            games. Bailey's performance was widely praised and she received accolades at the British Academy Games
            Awards, The Game Awards, and the NAVGTR Awards.

            Abby is described as having a "commanding presence", with her physical build reflecting the years of
            training and combat.[1] Her design underwent several iterations, with the goal to portray her as "capable,
            utilitarian, and strong".[2] When auditioning actors for Abby, creative director Neil Druckmann specifically
            wanted to avoid casting Laura Bailey due to her proliferation of roles; he had originally considered Bailey
            to play Dina. When reviewing her audition tape, however, Druckmann was impressed by how Bailey had played
            into Abby's vulnerability, whereas other actors emphasized her anger.[3] Bailey considers the game important
            to her personally, as she gave birth to her first son during production.[4] Prior to her pregnancy, Bailey
            was working out in preparation for the role.[5] She also prepared by researching people involved in wars and
            their coping mechanisms.[6] Abby's face is based on Jocelyn Mettler, a visual effects artist who formerly
            worked at Naughty Dog, while her body was based on athlete Colleen Fotsch
