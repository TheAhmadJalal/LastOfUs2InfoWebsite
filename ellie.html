        Ellie's flashback

            Ellie is a fictional character in the video games The Last of Us (2013) and The Last of Us Part II (2020).
            In the games, developed by Naughty Dog, she is portrayed by American actress Ashley Johnson through
            performance capture and voice acting; in HBO's upcoming television adaptation, she will be portrayed by
            English actress Bella Ramsey. In the first game, Joel Miller is tasked with escorting a 14-year-old Ellie
            across a post-apocalyptic United States in an attempt to create a cure for an infection to which Ellie is
            immune. While players briefly assume control of Ellie for a portion of the game, the artificial intelligence
            primarily controls her actions, often assisting in combat by attacking or identifying enemies.
            <br><br><br><br>

            Ellie reappeared as the sole playable character in the downloadable content prequel, The Last of Us: Left
            Behind, in which she spends time with her friend Riley. Ellie is also the main character in the comic book
            prequel, The Last of Us: American Dreams, wherein she befriends Riley and has her first encounter with the
            rebel group the Fireflies. In The Last of Us Part II, the player controls a 19-year-old Ellie as she seeks
            revenge on those responsible for Joel's death.

            <br><br><br><br>
            Ellie was created by Neil Druckmann, the creative director and writer of The Last of Us. Inspired by a mute
            character proposed for Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, he created her as a strong female character who has a
            close relationship with Joel; throughout the first game's development, the relationship between Ellie and
            Joel was the central focus, with all other elements developed around it. Johnson inspired aspects of Ellie's
            personality, prompting Druckmann to make her more active in fighting hostile enemies. Following comparisons
            to the likeness of Canadian actor Elliot Page, Naughty Dog redesigned Ellie's appearance to better reflect
            Johnson's personality and make her younger. For her performance in Part II, Johnson considered her own
            experiences with anxiety and researched the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder.
            <br><br><br><br>
            The character has been well-received by critics, with Ellie's relationship with Joel most frequently the
            subject of praise. The strength and complexity of her character, and its subversion of the damsel in
            distress stereotype, have also been commended. A scene in which Ellie and Riley kiss in Left Behind drew
            social commentary and was commended as a leap for LGBT representation in video games. Johnson's performance
            in Part II was praised for her depiction of vulnerability and suffering. Both the character and performance
            received numerous awards and nominations, and have regularly placed favorably in polls and lists.
